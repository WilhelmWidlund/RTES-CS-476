 * Description:
 *                                                                 
 * This example allows user intercation with the 5 other CPUs representing
 * each of the 5 dining philosophers.  Via STDIN, the user is prompted to
 * enter a chopstick number to toggle its state from acquired to released
 * or released to acquired.  Run the dining_philosophers.s application
 * on 5 CPUs to watch the interaction with philosophers_monitor.
 
 * Please refer to the Altera Multiprocessor Tutorial documentation for 
 * details on this software example.
